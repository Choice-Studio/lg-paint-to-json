Eddy’s private domain, accessed via a compact stone spiral staircase, included a bedroom, study and music room, where he would entertain fellow academics, philosophers, friends and lovers. This colour is taken from the fireplace in his bedroom, where it’s offset with a blue surround and charismatic lime-plastered walls.",

These colours were popular because they didn’t show dirt or damage easily, and were thriftily produced by blending leftover paints and pigments from the decoration of the main house.",

Fortunately, in the 1950s it came into the philanthropic hands of Lord and Lady Iliffe who endowed upon it a passion for renaissance interiors. This warm neutral was used on the walls of the Staircase Hall, designed to feel more like a sitting room than a cold corridor.",

It was first decorated by the Italian painter Francesco Sleter, who combined figurines, foliage and calligraphy in an intricate Chinoiserie style, with this sumptuous deep stone colour as a background. Paint research has shown this treasured building was repainted at least twice in the 19th-century and again in 1937. Following periods in Wotton, a neighbouring estate, and Ireland, the Chinese House was returned to Stowe to undergo a complete – but faithful – refurbishment in 1996.",

It was commissioned by the castle’s owner, a wealthy slate baron, and took 10 years to complete. The intermediate depth of this colour makes it a versatile shade, useful in both traditional and contemporary schemes. Highly impactful used in isolation, it’s also very easy to coordinate with a range of natural stone and wood surfaces.",

Driven by Wimpole’s owner’s keen architectural interest, the room doubled in size and this neutral green was specified as a foil to the room’s fine white plasterwork and shelving, and the thousands of deep red embossed leather book spines which covered the walls. The property was later acquired by Captain George Bambridge and his wife, Elsie, daughter of Rudyard Kipling. Kipling’s legacy and own book royalties paid for the refurbishment of the house before it was left to the Trust in 1976.",
